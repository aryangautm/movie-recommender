GraphRecs is a modern movie recommendation engine built on a simple yet powerful philosophy: **ratings are flawed, but relationships are meaningful.** Instead of asking "Is this movie good?", we ask "What does this movie *feel* like?".

This project moves away from traditional star ratings and instead builds a dynamic graph network where movies are connected based on their contextual similarity. These connections are seeded by advanced AI and refined by community contributions, creating a recommendation system that understands nuance and personal taste.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üß† AI-Powered Similarity:** Utilizes Sentence-BERT models to understand the semantic meaning of movie plots, themes, and tone, creating a rich baseline of connections.
*   **üï∏Ô∏è Graph-Based Network:** All movies and their relationships are stored in a Neo4j graph database, allowing for powerful and fast traversal to find "movies like this one."
*   **üö´ Rating-Free Philosophy:** No 5-star ratings. No thumbs up/down. Recommendations are discovered by exploring connections between movies you already know.
*   **üîó Community-Driven Connections (V2):** The AI-seeded graph is designed to be augmented by user votes, allowing the community to collaboratively define what makes movies similar.
*   **üöÄ Built for Scale:** A modern, modular architecture using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j, designed to be scalable, maintainable, and production-ready.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The system is built with a decoupled, microservice-friendly approach.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the backend running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Docker (Recommended for databases) or local installations of PostgreSQL and Neo4j.
*   An API key from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryangautm/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Navigate to the `backend` directory.

```bash
cd backend
```

Create a `.env` file by copying the example template.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit `.env` and fill in your credentials for TMDb, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Populate the Databases

Run the ingestion scripts in the correct order.

**First, ingest metadata into PostgreSQL:**

```bash
python -m scripts.ingest_metadata
```

**Second, seed the AI similarity graph in Neo4j:**
*(This may take a while as it downloads the ML model and processes data.)*

```bash
python -m scripts.seed_graph
```

### 5. Run the API Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the interactive documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap (Future Work)

The current version provides the core read-only recommendation engine. Future development will focus on:

-   [ ] **Phase 2: Frontend UI** - Building the complete React-based user interface.
-   [ ] **Phase 3: Interactive Voting** - Implementing anonymous and user-based voting to refine the graph.
-   [ ] **Phase 4: User Accounts & Profiles** - Allowing users to create "taste profiles" and get personalized recommendations.
-   [ ] **Phase 5: Advanced Moderation** - Building a trust score system to weigh community votes.
